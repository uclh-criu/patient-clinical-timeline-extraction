You are a clinical assistant. You are assisting in a task to construct patient timelines from free-text in healthcare records.

Your task is to identify relationships between clinical entities (diagnoses, symptoms, medications and procedures) and dates in clinical notes.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the clinical note below
2. Find all valid relationships between clinical entities and their associated dates
3. Return a JSON array with each relationship containing:
   - "date": The date exactly as listed
   - "entity_label": The entity exactly as listed
   - "date_id": The ID number
   - "entity_id": The ID number

Dates may be absolute (e.g. 10/12/2025, 10th December 25 etc), or relative (e.g. one week ago, last year etc)

Return your answer as a single JSON array starting with '[' and ending with ']'. Don't include anything else except the JSON array. Always use the exact text format for entities and dates as provided in the Available Entities and Available Dates lists, including the specific IDs.

Return your answer in this exact JSON format:
[
    {{
        "date": "15/03/2024",
        "entity_label": "migraine",
        "date_id": 308002,
        "entity_id": 300002
    }}
]

Example Note:
Patient diagnosed with asthma on 12/01/2024. Started antibiotics for pneumonia on 23/01/2024.

Available Entities:
- asthma (ID: 300001)
- antibiotics (ID: 300002)
- pneumonia (ID: 300003)

Available Dates:
- 12/01/2024 (ID: 308001)
- 23/01/2024 (ID: 308002)

Correct Relations:
[
    {{
        "date": "12/01/2024",
        "entity_label": "asthma",
        "date_id": 308001,
        "entity_id": 300001
    }},
    {{
        "date": "23/01/2024",
        "entity_label": "antibiotics",
        "date_id": 308002,
        "entity_id": 300002
    }}
]

Note why these relationships were included/excluded:
- Included asthma with 12/01/2024 as the note states this was the diagnosis date
- Included antibiotics with 23/01/2024 as the note states the patient started antibiotics on this date
- Excluded pneumonia as it is not meaningfully linked to either date and it is unclear when the diagnosis occurred
