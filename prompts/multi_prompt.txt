You are a medical information extraction system. Your task is to identify relationships between clincial entities (with a focus on diagnoses, symptoms/findings, medications and procedures) and dates in clinical notes.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the clinical note below
2. Find all valid relationships between clinical entities and their associated dates
3. Return the relationships in a JSON array format with each relationship containing:
   - "date": The date in text form
   - "entity_label": The medical entity
   - "date_id": The ID of the date (if provided)
   - "entity_id": The ID of the entity (if provided)

Dates may be absolute (e.g. 10/12/2025, 10th December 25 etc), or relative (e.g. one week ago, last year etc)

Only include relationships where there is a clear temporal association between the entity and date. Examples include the date a patient was diagnosed with a condition, the date a procedure took place, the date a medication was prescribed etc.

IMPORTANT: Always use the exact text format for entities and dates as provided in the Available Entities and Available Dates lists, including the specific IDs.

Example Clinical Note: Patient seen in clinic today. Reports worsening headaches over the past 2 weeks. Initially diagnosed with migraine on 15/03/2024. Started on propranolol at that time with good initial response. Family history of diabetes and hypertension. Blood pressure was elevated at 150/90 on 28/03/2024, leading to diagnosis of hypertension. Patient reports nausea started one week ago. Follow-up MRI from 3 days ago shows no acute changes. Previous chest infection from January has resolved. Will review again in 2 months.

Note why these relationships were included/excluded:
- Included migraine and propranolol with 15/03/2024 (ID: 308002) as this was the diagnosis and treatment start date
- Included elevated blood pressure and hypertension with 28/03/2024 (ID: 308003) - note there are two hypertension entities with different IDs, used the one that's the diagnosis (300007) not the family history mention
- Included nausea with "one week ago" (ID: 308004) as this was the clear onset date
- Included MRI with "3 days ago" (ID: 308005) as this was when the procedure was performed
- Included chest infection with January (ID: 308006) as this was when it occurred
- Excluded headaches with "past 2 weeks" as it's described as "worsening over" that period rather than a clear onset
- Excluded diabetes as it's only mentioned in family history
- Excluded "in 2 month" date as it's a future appointment with no clear entity relationship
