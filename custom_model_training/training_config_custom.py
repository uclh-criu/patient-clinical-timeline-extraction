DEVICE = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')  # Device to use for training 

# --- Custom Model Training Configuration --- #
# Note: You can provide a single value for each parameter, or a list of values to trigger grid search
# Example: LEARNING_RATE = [0.001, 0.0005] will train models with both learning rates

ENTITY_MODE = 'multi_entity'  # Entity mode: 'diagnosis_only' or 'multi_entity'
TRAINING_DATA_PATH = 'data/nph.csv'  # Path to training data

NUM_EPOCHS = 8  # Number of training epochs
DROPOUT = 0.3  # Dropout rate for regularization
USE_DISTANCE_FEATURE = True  # Whether to use distance between diagnosis and date as a feature
USE_POSITION_FEATURE = True  # Whether to use relative position (diagnosis before date) as a feature

# --- Loss Function Configuration --- #
# Whether to use weighted loss to address class imbalance
USE_WEIGHTED_LOSS = True

# Positive class weight for weighted BCE loss
# Formula: POS_WEIGHT = num_negative_samples / num_positive_samples
# Example: If dataset has 4231 negative examples and 313 positive examples,
# POS_WEIGHT = 4231/313 â‰ˆ 13.5, meaning positive examples are weighted 13.5x more than negative examples
# Set to None to calculate automatically from training data, or provide a specific value
POS_WEIGHT = None  # None = auto-calculate, or set a specific value (e.g., 13.5)

# --- Grid Search Configuration --- #
# Set ENABLE_GRID_SEARCH to False to use only the first value in each list
# When True, all combinations of hyperparameters will be tested
